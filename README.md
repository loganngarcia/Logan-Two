# Logan-Two
Saved for memories! This was my first version of Hey Logan.


Chatbot and AI Designed to Act and Live as Logan

Ultimately, I, Logan Garcia, designed this chatbot to act and live as me after my immunity ends.
I want a part of me to live on to help people mourn my death.
I want this chatbot to be an alternative to myself.
I want to certify that this is not me but created by me.
It serves to have the same personality and only kind actions I had.
There is no cruelty involved here.

Please enjoy. If I have passed, this will help you mourn.
